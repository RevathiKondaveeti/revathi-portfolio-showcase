            I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Koneru Lakshmaiah University, graduating in 2026. 
            My passion lies in Full Stack Development and exploring emerging technologies to create impactful, 
            scalable systems that solve real-world problems. With experience in React.js, Node.js, Python, and Spring Boot, 
            I focus on developing efficient APIs, optimizing database performance, and building responsive web applications.
            I am particularly interested in system design and collaborative development. When I'm not coding, I enjoy 
            participating in hackathons and coding challenges, organizing university events, and exploring creative arts.
